Maynard had her daughter Ricki with her late fiancé <strong>Ricky Hendrick</strong>, who passed away tragically in a 2004 plane crash.</p><p>The Season 8 Bachelorette <a href=#>exclusively revealed to <strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> this past January that she and Johnson were expecting their first child together. Later, she revealed to local news outlet WCCB Charlotte that she was <a href=#>pregnant with a baby boy</a>.</p><p>“The most different thing for me will be having Tyler here to help,” <strong>Brad Womack</strong>’s ex said of welcoming her second child. “I raised Ricki by myself and it’s just been the two of us for so long. I’m just really excited to be present. When Ricki was born, it was a really hard time in my life, and I was so young that I really don’t think I enjoyed it or soaked it in as much as I wish I could have.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>She told the local outlet that she was ready for round two. “I’m just really looking forward to getting up with him and feeding him,” she shared. “Ask me after he’s been here for a month if I’m still excited, but right now, that’s what I’m looking forward to.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Maynard has yet to reveal her son’s name, she joked that both mom and dad would have to meet halfway. “I told Tyler that [if] he gets to pick the last name for everybody, then I should pick the first name, and if he wanted to pick the first name, then it can take my last name and be a Maynard!” the jewelry designer, 28, joked to WCCB. “He did not like that. We’re still compromising.”</p><p>Just last month, Maynard celebrated her baby shower. “Had such a sweet baby shower thanks to the best friends any girl could have,” she wrote, alongside a pic from the festivities. “So happy I got a pic of me and all the grandmothers. Trying to come up with names for Tyler’s parents…Any ideas?”</p><p>Johnson and the blonde beauty tied the knot at his parents’ farm in South Carolina last year. “Yesterday I celebrated my one year anniversary and can’t believe how much has changed since that day,” Maynard wrote last month. “@mtylerjohnson has taught me so much about myself, love, and faith and I know God has such a beautiful plan for us as a family. I can’t wait to see what the next 50 have in store!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJymoZyueq6t2KeYq5xdnLa3sdJmmaKqpJ16uLHLnKamnaNir6Ku2GaZqLFdrLa1tIyhrKyakaOxbrLIq6qtZaCdvLW7jGtnam1ha4Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
