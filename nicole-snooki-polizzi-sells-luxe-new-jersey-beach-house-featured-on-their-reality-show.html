Then once it was all done, I came in and designed everything. It’s really fun; it’s a hobby of ours.”</p><p>Nicole has become an integral part of the neighborhood business community as well. Her original brick-and-mortar store, <a href=#>The Snooki Shop</a>, originally opened in Madison, New Jersey, in 2018. It then moved to a larger location in 2021. She also opened up a second storefront in Beacon, New York, in late 2020. The business carries clothing, accessories, jewelry, and other items that Nicole hand-picks for her customers.</p><p>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation airs on Thursdays at 8/7c on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ56esLC4xGaqp6efoLZuvM6loLOymWLAprjLrGSlraiaeq%2Bx1mahnqqjmsZursSamqFlmKTCtLGMn5yarKWnsqV5zqdkraCVnr9uvsSao6KsqWLAqbvWaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
