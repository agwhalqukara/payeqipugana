This fan said in a DM to MJF: “My dad literally raises my entire family from his manager salary from Applebee’s. You piece of sh*t. Die.”</p><p><a href=#>Maxwell Jacob Friedman has received death threats before. </a>So, he knew just how to handle this irritated fan by responding with:</p><p>Your father is a bum.</p><p>Your father raised a bum.</p><p>And I’d say you’ll raise one too but you are going to die a virgin.</p><p>This should probably be a message to any fan out there willing to slide into MJF’s DMs. There is a very good chance he will tweet out a screenshot of your personal communication and put you on blast in front of the entire IWC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>September 11, 2019 5:26 pm</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e49yZmppX6K3p3nRnq2emZyoeqWxwK2fZqyYp7KiwIyhnGaqlZiyqsLEnWSanqSav26uwKyfoqaXYq6xvMuemZ6do2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
