One year, her approach to fitness involved a skiing trip of New Year's, and "lots of dance rehearsals," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Express</span></a><span>. "Rather than going to the gym or running I prefer doing yoga or boot- camp classes because then I don't realise I'm working out – it's just fun."&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/pixie-lott-2.jpg><p><span>"I don't diet but I try to be good generally. I make sure I have my five a day," she told Express. "I wouldn't deprive myself of anything, though. I had a good, substantial breakfast today of avocado on toast with eggs, which keeps me going."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/pixie-lott-5.jpg><p><span>Pixie takes time out of her busy schedule for self-care. "I love massages and facials. If I could go to a spa every morning that would be amazing – I hardly ever get time to go," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/pixie-lott-1.jpg><p><span>Pixie trains at London-based </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Roar Fitness</span></a><span> with Sarah Lindsay. They recently shared her workout routine, which includes deadlifts, chest presses, single arm rows, squats, and bicep extensions. "Pixie Lott hits this workout x3 per week with a rest day in between workouts for recovery," they wrote. "After 2 weeks of progressing the weights to get stronger whilst improving base fitness levels, we'll then start to gradually move away from total body workouts, introducing new exercises whilst building on the the first 2 weeks of training."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/pixie-lott-3.jpg><p><span>"I've learnt so much about health, food and fitness from Sarah, but most importantly how to properly weight train," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she said in a testimonial for Roar</span></a><span>. "My strength continues to improve every session, and I love how lifting heavy makes me feel."</span></p><p><span>Her trainer told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Healthista</span></a><span> that Pixie's workout at the gym doesn't involve cardio. "My gym is weight training based – we don't have any cardio equipment here. I'm not anti-cardio, I do it myself. But I just don't think you should pay a trainer to watch you run on a treadmill. We are here to coach strength and conditioning, so every rep and set you do is coached properly. I think your role as a personal trainer should be to make sure you're progressing the programme properly over the right period of time. I believe that whatever your goals are, you can achieve the through weight training," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"With Pixie we lift as heavy as we can," added her trainer, Sarah. "She wants to be strong, she's not trying to get thin or anything. She likes having some muscles and wants to be stronger, so we work on that and I get her lifting as much as I can."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkqaGonrJuuM6tq2ahnmKvosDHoqWgZaOqtrV5yKxkm52RqsGqstSlZKKmXZ7BorjYaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
