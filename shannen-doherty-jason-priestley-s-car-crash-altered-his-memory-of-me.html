In a new interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>SiriusXM’s Just Jenny</a> host, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jenny Hutt</a>, Doherty conjectured that Priestley’s horrific 2002 car accident is probably what inspired him to write what she says are fictional tales.</p><p>“I love Jason, but you know he had a car accident, a racing accident, and I think maybe parts of his memory got altered from that,” Doherty, 43, alleged during the program, which is set to air on Friday, Jan. 16, at 8 p.m. EST. “Everybody changes. They have their own perception of the truth. His is definitely different than mine.”</p><p>Priestley, now 45, was involved in a scary, near-fatal car crash back in August 2002 that left him with a fractured spine and a serious head injury. At the time, he crashed his race car into the wall during the Indy Racing Infiniti Pro Series at Kentucky Speedway while going 180 mph.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shannen-Doherty-Says-Jason-Priestleys-2002-Car-Accident-Altered-His-Memory-of-Her-Bashes-His-Memoir-Diss-and-Talks-Tori-Spelling-2.jpg><p>Doherty and Priestley played siblings Brenda and Brandon Walsh on the<strong> Aaron Spelling</strong> teen series Beverly Hills, 90210 in the early ’90s. Doherty was written off the show in the fourth season in 1994 following behind-the-scenes drama, leaving a bad taste in the mouths of some of her costars, Priestley in particular. In his memoir, he specifically opened up about her reaction when Fox executives sent the stars a private jet for a last-minute New York City business meeting.</p><p>“I could not believe my ears at Shannen’s very first words after she boarded,” Priestley wrote. “Her butt had barely hit her seat before she said loudly to the PR person, ‘Really? A town car? You send a town car to take me to the airport, not a limo?’ She sighed a very put-upon sigh. I laughed, as I couldn’t really tell if Shannen was kidding or not.”</p><p>He continued: “But that was just the beginning. I looked on, becoming more uneasy by the minute as she began bitching about the short notice and the food on board and the temperature in the cabin and everything else.”</p><p>During her chat on Just Jenny, Doherty commented on the transportation episode from Priestley’s book. “Supposedly I wanted a limo, and I’ve always hated limos my entire life,” she said. “I find them embarrassing and grotesque. I mean, there are things that would in no way happen. Like, I didn’t even go on that jet at that point in time. It’s like, ‘Wait, wait, wait! You totally confused me with somebody else maybe from the show?!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added: “I don’t really know. I just know that at some point everybody just needs to sell a book. Right?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shannen-Doherty-Says-Jason-Priestleys-2002-Car-Accident-Altered-His-Memory-of-Her-Bashes-His-Memoir-Diss-and-Talks-Tori-Spelling-3.jpg><p>The cast has all gone their separate ways since roaming the halls of West Beverly Hills High, with Doherty even rekindling her relationship with costar <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jennie Garth</strong></a>. (The actresses butted heads off camera back in the day.) “<strong>Ian [Ziering]</strong>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Brian [Austin Green]</strong></a>, and Jennie are the three that I’ve remained close with,” Doherty told Hutt.</p><p>As for <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Tori Spelling</strong></a>? The Off the Map star briefly commented on Spelling’s Lifetime reality series, True Tori, which famously laid bare Spelling’s devastating marriage crisis with husband <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Dean McDermott</strong></a>. “I would never in a million years choose that for myself. Ever. But she’s gotta — that’s her choice of how she wants to deal with it,” Doherty said. “Some people need to put it out there,” she added. “It is a choice I’d never make because there’s just no mystery.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqhmZ6jsq95w6ifnqqkrnqrrdKopWaoop6ytMDLnrCsZZOWv26v0ZqqoWWRocGmvsSdZKGho2K6prnOq7Bmp5ZiuqZ5kWlobmlmZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
