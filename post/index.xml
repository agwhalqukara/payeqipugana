Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now
You're here, that's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers grow.Marius
But you will live, 'Ponine - dear God above...
If I could heal your wounds with words of love...
Eponine
Just hold me now, and let it be.</description></item><item><title>Bengals JaMarr Chase exits with shoulder injury in win vs. Vikings: What it could mean for Tee</title><link>/bengals-ja-marr-chase-exits-with-shoulder-injury-in-win-vs-vikings-what-it-could-mean-for-tee.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bengals-ja-marr-chase-exits-with-shoulder-injury-in-win-vs-vikings-what-it-could-mean-for-tee.html</guid><description>Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase left Saturday’s game against the Minnesota Vikings in the fourth quarter with a shoulder injury.

その後、2008年には旦那と別居されていることが報道されました。
この時、冨永愛さんはブログで、
「息子が幼稚園に通うことになったので、通園の拠点を考えたうえで引越ししたと本人から聞いています。もちろん普通にケンカもあるでしょうが、それはどこの夫婦でもあることでしょう」
「夫婦は山あり谷ありで、喧嘩もしますが（記事は多少過大）、3人で頑張っています」
と報道の内容を否定されました。
しかし、２００９年に離婚したことが報道されました。
その際にはブログで、
「どこの夫婦にもあるように、私達にも色々な事がありました」
「夫婦として歩んで行く中で、お互いのすれ違いや、進むべき道を見据えた上で、別々の道を歩んで行った方が、お互いにとっていいだろうと判断致しました」
「一生一緒に生きて行こうと誓った仲ですし、大切な息子もいますから、この決断は簡単に出した答えではありません。」
「もちろん母として、息子と二人で生きて行く不安はありますが、私らしく、前向きに生きて行こうと思います！ 皆さんこれからも温かい目で見守っていて下さい」
と、当時の離婚報道の内容の一部を否定しながらも、苦渋の決断で離婚したことを明かしていました。
当時、冨永さんは元旦那との離婚報道を否定されていましたが、それはプライベートな情報を守るためだったとされています。
冨永愛と旦那の離婚理由は嫉妬深さ。モラハラ説や収入格差説はガセ。元夫はどんな人だった？ 冨永愛さんの元旦那さんは年上でした。
馴れ初めは冨永愛さんがパリコレモデル時代にパリで出会っています。
元旦那さんの写真や、詳しい情報は公表されていませんが、現在の息子の姿から想像すると、章胤さんの眉毛とまつ毛は冨永愛さんよりも太く濃く、重いまぶたでより吊り上がった目をしているということで、毛が濃くて一重から奥二重の吊り目の男性だったのではないか？と憶測されています。
旦那との離婚の理由としては、冨永さん自身がのちに、
「嫉妬深いことが原因だった」
と語っています。
当時の週刊誌の報道の中には、
・パーティで冨永さんがノリでバニーガールのコスプレをしたら、旦那さんが大激怒。大勢の前で冨永さんに土下座謝罪を要求した。
・収入格差ゆえに夫婦でのすれ違いが起きていた。
という内容が書かれていましたが、それに対してはブログで、
「私達夫婦はご存知の通り海外を行き来する機会が多く、こういった事を招いてしまったと思っています。皆様にはご心配をかけた事と思いますが、特にそういう事実もありませんので、ご心配なさらないで下さい」
と否定していました。
離婚をブログで報告した際には、「彼が将来幸せになってくれる事を願っています」と綴られており、決して喧嘩別れをしたわけではなさそうです。
冨永愛の歴代の熱愛報道。離婚後に塩谷瞬と熱愛するも２股事件で破局。山本太郎や紀里谷とも関係 冨永愛さんが離婚後に熱愛の噂が出たのは2011年頃です。
当時は俳優として活躍されていた山本太郎さんと交際されていました。
冨永さんと山本太郎さんは、原発の問題で意気投合し交際に発展したのです。
冨永さんから結婚を意識していたそうですが、山本太郎さんはそこまでの将来は考えておらず、結局は破局してしまいました。
その後に、2012年頃に俳優の塩谷瞬さんと交際しました。
俳優の塩谷瞬さんとはお付き合いの末、プロポーズまで受けていたようです。
しかし、神田うのさんの提示した証拠で、塩谷瞬さんが料理研究家の園田真希絵さんにもプロポーズしていることが発覚したのです。
三角関係であったことが発覚すると、塩谷さんは世間からもうバッシングを受け、カメラの前で涙ながら謝罪することとなりました。
塩谷さんは二股交際の事実を認め、2人に直接会って謝罪したそうです。もちろん2人とは破局しました。
ただ、後に冨永さんも塩谷さんと交際した時点で山本太郎さんと完全に切れてなかったとの噂があるので、本当ならどっちもどっちですね・・・。
ちなみ、当時の週刊誌では、
「愛ちゃんは大きくなっていく息子さんのためには、男親がいたほうがいいと考えるようになったんです。山本さんとの関係がダメになっていく一方で、塩谷くんも気になっていったんじゃないですか。それで、山本さんと別れ、出会って間もないけど、自分だけでなく、子供のことも愛してくれる塩谷くんと、急速に親密になっていったんです」（前出・冨永の知人）
と、当時の冨永さんが、我が子の為に新しいお父さんを求めていたことが伝えられており、その焦りが出てしまったのではないか？とされています。
紀里谷や長渕剛とも熱愛の噂があった。不倫はガセネタ 冨永愛さんの元カレとして有名なのが山本太郎さんと塩谷瞬さんですが、その他にも噂になった有名人が何人かいます。
2011年頃から山本太郎さんと交際した冨永愛さんですが、実はその1年前に映画監督の紀里谷さんとも噂になっていたのです。
紀里谷さんといえば、宇多田ヒカルさんの元旦那であるということで、当時はバツイチ同士の大物カップルが誕生だと話題になっていました。
2010年に”今年に入って何度も紀里谷和明さんとは二人でデートしていた”と報じられたのです。
ただ、その関係については紀里谷さんは、「朝起きてビックリ。残念ながらこれ事実じゃないんですけど」と否定。
冨永愛さんも「本当じゃないんです。いいお友達です」と、二人とも熱愛報道を否定しています。
２人とも国際的な舞台で活躍されているということで、友人関係であることは事実のようです。</description></item><item><title>Alisha Wainwright - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</title><link>/alisha-wainwright-net-worth-age-height-birthday-bio-wiki.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/alisha-wainwright-net-worth-age-height-birthday-bio-wiki.html</guid><description>Explore Alisha Wainwright net worth, age, height, bio, birthday, wiki, and salary!

An anti-reflective coating and UV protection are included in the purchase of a pair of HD progressive lenses at Costco; the same glasses cost $255 at Walmart.
I’m also curious about the pricing of lenses at Costco.
The median price for a whole pair of eyeglasses (frames and lenses) at Costco Optical, according to Consumer Reports, is $184 for a complete pair.
As a result, the issue is whether or not Costco carries high index lenses.</description></item><item><title>Inside Look at Kim Kardashian's New $70 Million Malibu Home</title><link>/inside-look-at-kim-kardashian-s-new-70-million-malibu-home.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/inside-look-at-kim-kardashian-s-new-70-million-malibu-home.html</guid><description>Take a look inside the $70 million Malibu mansion Kim Kardashian just bought from Cindy Crawford —&amp;nbsp;the biggest real estate sale in Malibu in 2022.
