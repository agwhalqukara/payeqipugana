He coached the University of Virginia Cavaliers to a championship, the team's first Final Four appearance in 35 years. This came just one season after the Cavaliers suffered the biggest upset in NCAA Tournament history, a 20-point blowout against the 16-seed UMBC Retrievers.
Naturally, the university hopes Bennett will stay with them for a long time. So this summer, Virginia offered its coach a raise worth half a million dollars – and Bennett turned it down."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So this summer, Virginia offered its coach a raise worth half a million dollars – and Bennett turned it down.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Instead, he wants that money to go towards his staff and other benefits for the Cavaliers basketball program. He also pledged $500,000 toward a career-development program for current and former Cavaliers basketball players.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bennett credits his wife Laurel for the idea. She asked how their family could make a difference – providing back to the university is right in line with that.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-287589 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1141351099.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-287589 class=wp-caption-text>Tom Pennington/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Bennetts' generosity will also allow other Virginia athletics programs to thrive. A fundraising project is already underway to build a new football operations center and a new Olympics sports center.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The sports center will feature a Center for Citizen Leaders and Sports Ethics. That's part of a university-wide program where athletics and academics come together to provide opportunities in career, leadership, personal development, community engagement, and academic achievement.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Is giving up half a million dollars short-sighted? Not for Bennett, who's entering his 11th year as Virginia's men's basketball coach. He's at peace with how much he's made, <a href=# rel=noopener>which includes $4.15 million last year</a>. He says he sees "the big picture" of what the university is trying to do, and wants to contribute how he can.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He restructured his deal to add another year, keeping him in Virginia for at least seven more seasons. The Cavaliers have made seven NCAA Tournament appearances in his ten seasons.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Perhaps nothing will top Bennett and the Cavaliers winning a championship just 12 months removed from a humiliating NCAA Tournament upset. But this is a pretty impressive encore.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2mp7Fdl7KvusStq2aspae7prCMnaawpl2WenZ8j2lnaWWilra0sYyspmasmJp6trrIr5yrq5mpxm67xWatoqqXnruqrYycpq6klGLAta3RrWSaZZOWv6ax0Wanq6eXp66uecinqq2dkZl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
