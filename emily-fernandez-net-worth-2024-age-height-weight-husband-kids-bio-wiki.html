If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Emily Fernandez’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Emily Fernandez came into this world on 30 June 1992 with the special condition of dwarfism. She was born in Pennsylvania, United States, and while she was just a baby, her biological parents gave her up for adoption. As it is said that the real pain of a person in certain situations can be understood only by the people who have gone through that exact or at least similar situation, Emily was adopted by a dwarf couple.</p><p>Her adoptive sister, Sara, shares the family’s condition. Emily was welcomed warmly in her new family, but unfortunately, her adoptive mother died when she was just sixteen.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Emily Fernandez has a daughter named Eva, details of whose father is not known. Unlike her mother, Eva is not a dwarf. After the birth of Eva, Emily fell in love with a person who, at that time, was known less by his TV career and more by his criminal records.</p><p>His name is Lionel Jahnar Johnson, and he has been convicted in many criminal cases, like that of theft and physical assault. After being in a relationship for three years, Emily and Lontel gave birth to a boy in April 2016. His name was Lontel JJ Johnson Jr., and much like his mother, he too was born with dwarfism.</p><p>Due to serious health problems, JJ passed away when he was just three months old, an incident that left the couple scarred and heart-broken leading Lontel to decide that he didn’t want to have any more children. However, due to Emily’s request, he agreed to go for IVF for the birth of their next child. Emily went through two surgeries, but unfortunately, both of the surgeries failed. At present, Emily seems happy with her only daughter Eva.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 25 May 1980, Emily Fernandez is 44 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. Her height is 1.27 m tall, and her weight is 57 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Emily Fernandez was initially a club dancer with her friend Bri Barlup. The duo even appeared in the music video of “Da Wop” by rapper Lil Chuckee. Emily (Right cheek) with Bri (Left cheek) then performed as a duo known as “The Cheeks.” In 2016, Emily went back to her hometown to live with her family and joined “Little Women: Dallas,” as its cast member.</p><p>In 2017, Emily recorded a song with Dreadz (a rapper) titled “Lifetime.” From then on, she has been in a rumored relationship with Dreadz. Emily has her own official Youtube channel called “OFFICIALLCRC.” Looking at the songs uploaded on this channel, it can be said that Emily is a well-known singing figure. In 2017, Emily and Bri launched three singles named “Poppin’ Bottles,” “Gettin Rich,” and “HD.” The “Poppin’ Bottles” video, which was posted on their Youtube channel, crossed 12 million views in just two months.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Instead of looking at her dwarfism with inferiority, Emily Fernandez turned it into her opportunity. To date, she has worked in two American TV series that focus on the lives of dwarf women titled “Little Women: Atlanta” and “Little Women: Dallas.” These series were released by the Lifetime network on 27th January 2016 and 2nd November 2016, respectively.</p><p>Many reports in recent times show that after acting and singing, Emily is now being sought after by the dancing community as well. Though there are no formal awards in her name to date, according to a biography of Emily on Lifetime’s website, it is known that on the sets of “Little Women: Dallas,” Emily is treated as the most talented member of the group.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Emily Fernandez in 2024</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Emily-Fernandez-Net-Worth.jpg alt="Emily Fernandez Net Worth 2019" width=888 height=506 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>As of July 2024, Emily Fernandez’s net worth is $1 million.
