Answer
 Capodimonte Flowers, Figurines, Vases, Lamps, and Chandeliers are valued and priced according to their intrinsic value. However, although certain Capodimonte Italian porcelains are worth a fortune, the vast majority of beautiful vases and lamps from the mid to late 1900s are only worth a few hundred dollars (at the most) rather than thousands of dollars.
