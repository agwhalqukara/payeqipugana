He is also known by his stage name Marky Mark.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mark Wahlberg spent his entire childhood in Boston. He was born in 1971 in the Dorchester neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts as the youngest of nine children. He attended Copley Square High School on Newbury Street in Boston, but he dropped out before graduating.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>To learn more about Mark Wahlberg’s childhood, criminal past and how he turned his life around, keep reading.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mark Wahlberg’s Criminal Past</h2><p>Mark Wahlberg’s childhood was unusual by many standards. He was born as the youngest of nine kids in 1971, and his parents divorced in 1982 when Mark was 11 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>After the parents’ divorce, Mark divided his time between the two and his life took a turn. Before the age of 13, Mark started doing drugs and became involved in street violence.&nbsp;</p><p>At 13, he already developed an addiction to cocaine and other substances. His violent behavior got worse over time <a href=# class=rank-math-link rel=noopener>as he got arrested over 20 times</a>, and it reached a breaking point when Mark was 16.&nbsp;</p><p>At 16, <a href=# class=rank-math-link rel=noopener>Mark assaulted a Vietnamese man</a> with a wooden stick and punched in the eye, and was charged with attempted murder. Wahlberg was consequently sentenced to serve two years at Boston’s Deer Island House of Correction but ended up serving only 45 days.&nbsp;</p><p>The sentence was a turning point for Wahlberg as he realized he needed to turn his life around. Mark continued working on his music career that he started at the age of 13.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mark After Prison</h2><p>At 13, Mark was actually one of the original members of his brother’ band, “New Kids on the Block”. However, he quit and formed his own hip hop group called “Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch”.&nbsp;</p><p>Their debut album was released in 1991 and the song “Good Vibration” made it to the top of Billboard Hot 100. The second album was released not too long after, but it was not a success and the band broke up.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1993, Wahlberg transitioned from being a singer to being an actor. His acting debut was made on the film “The Substitute”. Over the years, <a href=# rel=noopener>Mark played in many notable movies</a> such as “Boogie Nights”, “Planet of the Apes”, “Invincible”, “The Departed”, and “The Fighter”.&nbsp;</p><p>His roles in the movies “The Departed” and “The Fighter” were very well received and Wahlberg received several awards for them. In addition to being an actor, Wahlberg also took on a role as an executive producer on HBO.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>He produced five HBO series</a> including “Entourage”, “Boardwalk Empire”, and the documentary about McDonald’s called “McMillions”.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mark Wahlberg Today&nbsp;</h2><p>Not only did Mark Wahlberg leave his criminal history behind, but he set a very calm and peaceful life for himself. He revealed that his life is mostly normal even though he is a celebrity, but he enjoys the everyday activities such as going to the supermarket by himself.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>He chooses not to attend parties, dinners, or award shows</a> if his movies aren’t relevant to the occasion. Wahlberg prefers to spend his time with his children and his wife, working on projects or doing his two-a-day workouts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He has a great passion for fitness and a healthy lifestyle. <a href=# rel=noopener>He invested</a> in “Performance Inspired Nutrition”, a natural workout supplement company, and in “Aquahydrate”, a water brand.</p><p>Wahlberg also invested $450 million in an Australian fitness franchise called “F45 training” that has helped speed up the company’s global expansion strategy. His acting and entrepreneurial ventures ramped up Mark Wahlberg’s <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth to $300 million</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Wahlberg revealed <a href=# rel=noopener>his crazy day-to-day schedule</a> on his Instagram stories. His day starts at 2:30 am with one workout at 3 o’clock in the morning and the second at 4 o’clock in the afternoon.
