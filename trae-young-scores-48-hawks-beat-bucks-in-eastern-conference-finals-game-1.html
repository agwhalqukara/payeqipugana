They're fearless. They're confident. They ooze swag. They believe they can win any single game no matter if they’re labeled underdogs or not.</p><p>It’s a special group that feels like there isn’t a ceiling on how far it can go, and that’s what we’re seeing. This was a team that was 14-20 at one point but never stopped believing.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h5>How do the Bucks adjust to Trae Young?</h5><p>Eric Nehm, Bucks beat writer: In the first half, it was clear the Bucks were going to give Young looks at his floater while taking everything else away. Then, in the third quarter, he got a couple lobs to the Hawks' big men and hit some 3s. Eventually, he was getting everything he wanted.</p><p>To end the game, the Bucks played Antetokounmpo at the five in a small-ball configuration and switched everything defensively. This stagnated the Hawks offense, but the Bucks gave up offensive rebounds in the waning moments.</p><p>Going forward, they need to make it tougher on Young by sticking to their game plan better and also executing multiple defensive schemes to give him tougher looks.</p><p>(Photo: Nathaniel S.
