Her <a href=# rel>"IDGAF" approach to life and the industry</a> has helped skyrocket her to fame. Back in 2017, we got a peek at how her brain operates and the way she views life. She sat down for an interview with DJ Smallz Eyez, around the time when she began to gain notoriety. The interview was funny for how ridiculous and blunt <a href=# rel>Sukihana</a> was throughout.</p><p>A question that DJ asked her was, "[What was the] craziest rumor you ever heard about yourself?" Sukihana said that people were making assumptions about a fling with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Yung Joc</a>. A tweet from her account in 2017 read, "Just sucked yung Jocs d*** and balls for 4 hours and it tasted like fried chicken #neveragain." It is a crazy tweet for sure and it has recently been gaining traction online.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Natalie Nunn Claims She's Taking Legal Action Against Restaurant Denying Service Over Zeus Network Affiliation</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sukihana-did-what-it-tasted-like-what>Sukihana Did What!? It Tasted Like What!?</h2></span><p>The Jasmine Brand found tons of quoted tweets responding to the original message. Of course, have been flabbergasted by it. However, Sukihana dispelled the rumor in the same Smallz Eyez interview. She claimed that her account was hacked and that she only messes with drug dealers and scammers. Yung Joc was never any of those things and they also may be a reason why that tweet may also not be true. Hackers on social media are very prevalent as well, so Sukihana may be telling the truth.</p><p>What are your initial thoughts on these old tweets circulating between Sukihana and Yung Joc? How do you think they resurfaced and will either of them respond to them coming back up? Do you think someone hacked into Sukihana's Twitter account, or is she bluffing?
