As such, Ford, who was born July 13, 1942, in Chicago, was 40 when “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” was released on May 8, 1984.</p><p>There was a much longer break between the second Indy chapter and the third film in the original trilogy, since “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” wasn’t released until May 24, 1989. By that time, Ford was on the verge of turning 46.</p><p>Nearly 20 years passed, of course, between the third and fourth chapter in the film saga, which meant Ford was 65 when “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” was released in theaters on May 22, 2008. Tacking on another 15 years in the long run-up to “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” Ford was 80, when the film was released on June 30, 2023.</p><p>Recently reflecting on his time starring in the saga, Ford said he has kept one thing in mind portraying Indiana Jones since 1981 — to further embrace the complications his character faces as the years roll by. Ford told Yahoo! Entertainment that he wanted to know more about Indy with each film, and in the case of “The Dial of Destiny,” it was about aging and the effects it had on his adventures.</p><p>“I wanted it to be about what it’s like to be an older archeologist,” Ford told Yahoo! Entertainment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cLTOsGSopJRixKK%2FjKGYq6qZqLyvecWoqZ1lmaN6s63InZyrq12ks27Ax55kpaejqXqivspo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
